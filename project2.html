        <p>The acheulian tool kit is the tool kit we chose. We chose it because <br>it was made around 1.8 Million years before the first, but way more advanced than the original tool kit. 
            <br>The acheulean tool kit was made from the species Homo Erectus meaning “standing/upright man” in latin. The reason they were named homo erectus (Australopithecus africanus) is because<br> they were the first bipedal hominids. \
            Researchers think that the tools were made around 1.7 Million years ago, <br>  because of radiometric dating,  potassium-argon dating, and magnetostratigraphy. The tools in the acheulean tool kit was most commonly made of flint, 
            but was sometimes made of quartzite, andesite, sandstone, chert, and shale, and were made by hitting 
            them against bigger rocks, and <br>removing flakes from rocks in a systematic manner. They were also made by scraping it against an object similar to an anvil. 
            The tools were found in Konso, Ethiopia, and were originally used for hunting animals and crushing, pounding, and cutting meat. This tool kit is important because this <br>more advanced form of stone tools indicated a leap forward
             in mental knowledge, and shows that humans started to evolve cognitively around that time.  
            Overall, the acheulean tool kit was a big part in the history of hominids.
