    Death and Mr Hoods
    In the book “The Thief Of Always”  written and illustrated by Clive Barker, two boys <br>
    named Harvey and Wendell has to escape a place full of power and magic. Harvey and <br>
    Wendell is trapped in a place called “Happy Land”, Mr.Hood the owner of this place<br>
     uses his power of magic to keep them in the house. Mtr. Hood can be compared between <br>
     death, though death is natural and he is not. The difference between death and Mr.Hood <br>
     are death is slowly coming, Mr. Hoods is a spectacle thing and Death is wanted sometimes<br>
     and Mr.Hoods is never wanted<br>
    Death is natural, it always happens it can be hard but humans will overcome death slowly. Death<br>
     has to continue for the Earth to work, also if there are no deaths, time wont go on. Where as Mr.Hoods<br>
      is not planned. Mr. Hood breaks time, life and death. One day is Mr. Hoods house is a year in<br>
       the world, so if you stay there for 31 days like Harvey did, 31 years have passed in the world. <br>
       Since time goes so slow at Mr. Hood’s house, death will never arrive.<br>
        Mr. Hood’s house is never expected, after you enter the mist that leads you into the “Happy” Land,<br>
         your life will change and your time with your parents will be wasted. Also everything at Mr. Hood;s<br>
          house is an illusion, you think and feel like it's real but every thing there is made of  dust <br>
          and dirt. Even the food there is dust and dirt that lead the antagonist Jive to die.<br>
        As human’s life goes on, some is ready to die. Sometimes death is welcomed when the person is old<br>
         enough. Where as Mr. Hoods is never welcoming anywhere in your lifetime. Death is welcomed because<br>
          after a person lives for a long time, they do not want to have any more obstacles to face because<br>
           they have faced enough and they are too tired for it. Mr. Hoods in the other hand, he is never <br>
           wanted because people don't want to be traped, fooled and don't want to live forever.<br>
        There are many comparison between Mr. Hoods and death, to summarize it, death is natural and <br>
        Mr. Hoods is not. Death will naturally occur and Mr. Hoods turn kids into fish so they are trapped <br>
        there forever. 
    
    
        I think Clive Barker turned the kids into fish because fish has to stay in water for them to live so fish will be always be trapped in water.
