    I think the theme of the novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is how sacrifices are necessary for victory because in this novel many lives are sacrificed in order to defeat Lord Voldemort. In the book, there is a war between Voldemort and Harry Potter. On each side, they both have an army. But whereas Voldemort has an army that uses dark spells and is made up of people who want to kill others, Harry has an army of his friends, professors and other adults that support him. During the war, people are often killed while trying to find or protect Harry. Aside from the war itself, many people’s lives are taken away while Harry and his friends look for the horcruxes. For example, when they go into Bellatrix’s vaults to find a horcrux, the workers there are killed by the dragon and a few more deaths by falling off the railing. All of these sacrifices allowed the good side to win the war at the end of the novel.
