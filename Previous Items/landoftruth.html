            The Land Of Truth
A few days ago, two kids named Harvey and Wendell escaped from this place called “Happy Land”.
The kids were glad to be back but they couldn't resist exploring that place. After the horrifying
experience at “Happy Land” Wendell hesitated to go into the mist but HArvey managed to convince
him. Soon enough, they were in the mist. By the time they arrived, the land was empty with dead
grass. They then began exploring a local town. Believe it or not, it was an another house full
of magic called “Real Land”. This time…. It was different, there were real food, real people and
real feel to the touch. The kind gentle house owners welcomed them in with some roasted chicken.
They were starving so they starting digging in right away. Then they both said “WOW! The food is
so good” Unlike the “Happy Place, this place was real, calming and welcoming. Harvey looked at his
watch to see what time it was. “Weird, I think my watch is broke, it’s not moving at all”. After
the food, fthe house owners and Harvey started discussing about what they should do. After a
while Wendell became worried thinking that they will be stuck there, but Harvey was already
obsessed. When the owners realized why Wendell was worried they told him that he can go in
and out whenever you want tot. Though after the terrible horrifying experience, Wendell did
not believe them. When Harvey and Wendell went out to play, they noticed a huge tree house.
They both whispered “Look at that!”, Then they both ran up to the enormouse tree house. Up
at the tree house, the boys had a better view of the area. “Wow it's beautiful” Harvey said.
The garden was full of flowers and the grass was cut perfectly. “Dinner’s ready” The owners
said. They had a delicious pie. After dinner, Harvey and Wendell decided to go back. Once
they reached the mist, the house looked sad as if the houses wanted them to stay. Harvey
promised the house that he will come back soon and left into the mist. Once they came back,
they thought another year has passed, but everything was same as well as the date. When
Harvey checked his broken watch, it started working normal as if nothing happened, first
Harvey thought his watch was fixed, but as the time passed on, he realized that his watch
was not broken, and that there is no time at “Real World”. Harvey had many things coming
into his brain at once. Then Harvey though “Hmm… if I bring my parents with me, they might
never die!” After explaining everything to his parents, his parents agreed on it and started to
prepare. Wendell also tried to convince his parents but his parents said “We are guilty for
divorcing and ruining your life, and we would rather die than live, go on your life and never
give up”. After few days, Wendell and Harvey’s family was ready to go, since there is no magic
keeping adults out of the mist, they were all able to get in. Harvey’s parents were overwhelmed
of the view and was already happy with the decision. Harvey introduced his parents to the
house owner and asked if they could stay. “The house owners gladly said “Yes, of course” and l
ead them into the house. Harvey’s parents were extremely satisfied and took some rest. Later of
the day, the owners called the family for dinner. Today they had delicious cooked fish
which has been freshly caught from the ocean. After the meal, there were dozen dirty dishes
being washed by magic. When it was bedtime, Harvey laid on the red bed, the bed craittled good
night and Harvey fell into a calm peaceful sleep.
