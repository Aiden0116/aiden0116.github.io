        Elite Essay

        The novel, “The tiger rising”, by Kate Dicamillo, shows why things should not be locked up.
         In the novel there are good reasons like tiger being free letting Rob’s sad feelings out,<br>
         and bad reason like when animal was released it won’t survive.<br>
            In the novel there is a tiger that Beauchamp owns, and Rob have the key to the tiger’s<br>
             cage to feed the tiger. When Sistine found his secret, she kept on telling Rob to free<br>
              the tiger. So Rob decides to let the tiger go. After releasing the tiger the tiger was<br>
               shot by Rob’s dad and it died. There are good reasons freeing the tiger and bad reasons<br>
                freeing the tiger. Good reason is that he will have much more space and the bad reason<br>
                 is that they know what would happen, it could eat them or cause a lot of trouble in <br>
                 the city. Though in the novel it was shot by Rob’s dad and died.<br>
            When Rob and Sistine was talking to Willy May she said she had a pet but it died. <br>
            She said she let the bird go because she thought it was wrong to keep animals in cage.<br>
             So she let the bird go but her dad killed the bird. Also she had the same reason as Rob<br>
              and Sistine had when they let the tiger go. To replace Willie May’s bird, Rob carved<br>
                  bird that look like the bird that Willy May had.<br>
        In the novel Rob mom died so that’s the reason why he never talk about his mom and he says<br>
         he keep it in the suitcase. Though after the tiger died it changed, now he and his father<br>
          talks about their mom. They talk about what she like to do, eat and sing with his dad. <br>
          Though the reason why they moved here is because they don’t want to talk their mom but <br>
          now it doesn’t matter anymore. Also it is good to open his suitcase and talk about his <br>
          mom because it is hard to keep things in especially something about a loss.<br>
        These are the reasons if it is good reason or bad reason to open and not keep things locked.<br> 
        Also to choose if it is good or not you have to think deeper and choose the better choice. <br>
        Maybe not animals but you should keep your sadness out because they are annoying to try not <br>
        to talk about it.
