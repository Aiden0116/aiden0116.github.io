                <h1>Samsung is A beter smartphone company</h1>
    <p>
        Samsung is a better smartphone company
        Many smartphone brands have been battling against each other for the 1st place in the market and the most competitive brands are Apple and Samsung. 
        There are many amazing phone brands such as apple, but I prefer Samsung the most. Worldwide, 
        people use many different phone brands, but in Canada, Apple iPhones are mostly used. Though, I don’t think the people are saying that Apple is 
        better than Samsung. Samsung is a better smartphone brand because of battery, design and compatibility.
    Battery life on a mobile phones is very important because mobile phones are used 
    everyday, all day by everyone. People use phones all day so the battery on mobile phones 
    should last all day. Samsung phone battery and Apple iPhone batteries both last for a very long time, 
    but Samsung lasts for slightly longer than Apple do. Samsung s10 lasts for 12 hours and 35 minutes whereas
     apple’s iPhone X lasts for 9 hours and 51 minutes. If a Samsung phone user manages to drain out the battery,
      the user’s phone can be wirelessly charged with a S10 by using “Power Share”. If an iPhone user drains the 
      battery, the user can charge it by Samsung’s S10 “Power Share” or the user will have to charge it with a 
      lighting bolt cable that Apple provides with user’s phone. If there is no choice other than to use a cable 
      to charge their phones, they will have to use a cable to, Samsung uses type-c cable which is much more 
      powerful and faster than Apple’s lightning cable which Apple has been using forever. When it comes to battery,
       Samsung offers longer and faster charging than Apple.
    People in 2019 want different, and futuristic design for their phone. Design wise,  everyone
     around me prefers Samsung over Apple. First, Samsung has more colour choices and Samsung comes 
     up with a new design every release whereas Apple comes up with new design every 4 years and the
      change they make is a very small change. Also the edge screen on Samsung phones make their phone
       look more like from future that Apple with nig bezel around the phone screen. Not only edge adds
        a futuristic looks to it, it increases the screen size to make a video more enjoyable.
    People use many accessories with their phone and accessories should be compatible with 
    user’s phone. Apple OS (Operating system) does not allow many technology brands to connect with the
     phone but Samsung phones are more compatible with other devices such as ps4 controller. If you want to 
     use an accessory, you have to purchase an Apple branded one. The smart watches Samsung and Apple makes 
     works the best on it’s platform but you can connect a Samsung watch to an iphone with few accessibility 
     whereas apple watches is not compatible with android at all. When it comes to compatibility, Apple makes 
     it so customers have to buy Apple accessories whereas Samsung, you can basically use any devices with it.
         However Apple and Samsung are both amazing brands that create amazing technology. It 
         is very hard to satisfy a customer with a phone, but I think there are more Satisfied Samsung users 
         than satisfied Apple users because of the battery, design and compatibility. 	Apple and Samsung will
          be battling for the 1st place on market but I think samsung deserves to be in the first place right 
          now for the small important things that Samsung takes an advantage on.
